-GPS, GLONASS, SBAS, QZSS are enabled by default
-Blue PPS LED blinking(1Hz) means 3D fixed
-update rate 1Hz & baudrate 9600 default
-Baud 9600~115200 supported by INAV
-update rate 5Hz with INAV UBLOX Protocol
-update rate 10Hz with INAV UBLOX7 Protocol
-BF doesn't support GPS position hold and RTH,  GPS Rescue mode is supported by BF3.5 or last.
-The scratches on ceramic antenna are the result of tuning the antenna by ublox. Placing small nicks in the centre of the long edges, or corners, brings them into spec.

BLUE = TX
YELLOW = RX
RED = 5V
BLK = GND
