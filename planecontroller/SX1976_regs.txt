RegDioMapping1  Mapping of pins DIO0 to DIO5

Implicit Header Mode
RxPayloadCrcOn

FifoAddrPtr
FifoRxBytesNb
RegFifoRxCurrentAddr
FifoRxBaseAddr = 0x00

FifoTxBaseAddr = 0x80
PayloadLength

RegFifoAddrPtr must be initialized before SPI op.
Then it is autoincremented

RegIrqFlagsMask
RegIrqFlags - indicates which irq trigger
In the register RegIrqFlags, a ‘1’ indicates a given IRQ has been trigged and then the IRQ must be clear by writing a ‘1’.

LoRaFeiValue measure frequency error
FErrHz = Fei * 2^24/32*10^6 * BW/500

register 0x27 compensate freq error offset.

In order to write packet data into FIFO user should:
1 Set FifoPtrAddr to FifoTxPtrBase.
2 Write PayloadLength bytes to the FIFO (RegFifo)
Write Data

wait for TX Done interrupt


Receive Continuous:
RxDone interrupt?
check PayloadCrcError

RegSymbTimeout 4 to 1023 symbols to wait in single RX mode


ValidHeader (even in implicit mode!), PayloadCrcError, RxDone and RxTimeout must check in RX
RegRxNbBytes Indicates the number of bytes that have been received thus far.
RegFifoAddrPtr is a dynamic pointer that indicates precisely where the Lora modem received data has been written up
to.

Alternatively, it is possible to manually point to the location of the last packet received, from the start of the current
packet, by setting RegFifoAddrPtr to RegFifoRxByteAddr minus RegRxNbBytes. The payload bytes can then be read
from the FIFO by reading the RegFifo address RegRxNbBytes times.


Receive:
Set FifoAddrPtr to FifoRxBaseAddr.
A single packet receive operation is initiated by selecting the operating mode RXSINGLE.
